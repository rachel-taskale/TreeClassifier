    # each filter is a collection of kernels with there being 1 kernel for every single input channel and each kernel being unique
    # each filter in a convolutional layer produces 1 and only 1 output channel
    # Each per channel processed version are then summed together to form one channel and the filter as a whole produces one overall output channel

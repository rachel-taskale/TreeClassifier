        "about": "Norway maple is native to continental Europe and western Asia. It was introduced to the United States in the mid- to late 1700s in eastern Pennsylvania [10,36]. A current, accurate description of Norway maple distribution in North America is problematic. It is widely planted throughout much of North America, especially along urban streets and in yards. In many areas it escapes into surrounding forest and woodlands, where it may become invasive (see Impacts). Precise distribution information for Norway maple is lacking.",
